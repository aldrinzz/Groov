Groov: Wearable Music Experience

Groov is a wearable product that enables users to play musical instruments—currently drums, violin, and piano—by mimicking the motions of playing them. The device connects via Bluetooth to a mobile app, producing the corresponding sounds without the need for the physical instruments themselves.

Features
	•	Wearable Instrument: Play drums, violin, and piano with simple hand gestures.
	•	Bluetooth Connectivity: Syncs seamlessly with the mobile app via Bluetooth.
	•	Realistic Sound Output: Instrument sounds are played through the app, allowing a natural musical experience.
	•	Motion Sensing: Microcontrollers in the wearable detect movements and translate them into sound.

How It Works
	1.	Wear the Device: Put on the Groov device like a wristband or glove.
	2.	Select an Instrument: Choose between violin, drums, or piano via the connected app.
	3.	Mimic the Actions: Perform gestures like strumming a violin, tapping a drum, or playing piano keys.
	4.	Hear the Sound: The device sends motion data via Bluetooth to the app, which generates and plays the corresponding sound.

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React Native (or the framework you’re using for the app)
	•	Backend: Node.js, Python, or your chosen backend stack (specify here)
	•	Hardware: Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) for motion detection and Bluetooth connectivity
	•	Bluetooth: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication between the wearable and the mobile app
